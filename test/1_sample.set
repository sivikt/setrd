# For the sake of simplicity and monosemantic set definition language 
# doesn't allow us to define unnamed sets as an elements of other sets.
# Instead you have to extract such definition in a separate line.

# Anyway, it's just a C lang playing and not pretend to be a fine organized
# mathematically rigorous and consistent set definition language.
